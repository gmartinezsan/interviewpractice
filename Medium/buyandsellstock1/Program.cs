// Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
// If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
// Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
// Example 1:
// Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
//              Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
// Example 2:
// Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
